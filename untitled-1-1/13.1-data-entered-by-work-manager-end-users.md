# 13.1 Data entered by Work Manager End Users

Enate will fully support a userâ€™s preferred language in Work Manager display and UI elements including labels, links and buttons, however anything added by you will stay in same language you originally entered it in and will not be auto-translated into any other language when being viewed by other users with a different preferred language.

For example, if a Brazilian user adds a note to a Case in Portuguese then Enate will save the note in Portuguese in the database and will only ever show the note in Portuguese.

Here is full list of items which will be driven by user input and which **WILL NOT** be auto translated by the product:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Item</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Detail</th>
