# 7.1 Overview of Work Item Types

There are three types of Work Item in Enate:

* **Cases** – Used for modelling multi-part activities \(i.e. business processes\).
* **Actions** – the constituent parts of a Case, i.e. a Case is made up of a flow of Actions. Contains a set of instructions, often a checklist of activities to track progress within the Action. These can be manual \(can be carried out by humans and bots\) or automatic Actions, e.g. auto sending an email.
* **Tickets** – Used for modelling single-part activities, e.g. queries. Tickets are standalone and are not part of a business process. Can be promoted to become a specific type of Case.
