### **Personalised Email Signature**

Enate’s Email Signature feature allows you to configure your own signature for outgoing emails. You can use the Email Signature section to define the signature content to be sent in outgoing emails which you write.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The configured email signature will only be included with the outgoing emails if the ‘**Include my signature in the outgoing emails’** checkbox at the foot of this section is checked.
{% endhint %}

After you have created a signature, clicking on any of the links to bring up the ‘compose new email’ section in any work item will display the configured email signature at the bottom of the email body.
