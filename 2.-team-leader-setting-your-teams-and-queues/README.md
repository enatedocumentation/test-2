# 2. Team Leader – Setting Your Teams and Queues

![](../.gitbook/assets/0%20%287%29.png)

As a Team Leader, the Home page needs to know who reports to you and what Queues you are in charge of. These settings can be adjusted in the **Queues** page, which you can open from the navigation section.

* If you have no data set up yet, the page will open in Edit mode by default. Otherwise, it will show the Queues that you manage \(along with the people who are working out of that Queue\), and the list of people who report to you, i.e. your Team.
* You can Edit these settings as follows:
  * Add a Queue. _Note: you are able to add yourself as a manager to a Queue. This includes Queues which may already be managed by a different Team Leader \(you will now both be managers of this Queue\)._
  * Remove a Queue, i.e. unset yourself as the manager of a Queue.
  * Add and remove Users to my Team. When you are adding users to your team, you do so by building up a list of the users who report to you. **A user can only report to one Team Leader**, so when you add a user to a team, you may be re-setting who they report to – if they previously reported to a different Team Leader that will now be wiped and reset to you. The previous manager will no longer be the manager of that user, and will not have visibility of them, unless they are still in Queues that the Team Leader manages.
  * Add / remove Team members to one or more of my Queues.
  * Add and remove Robots to my Queues. You can add/remove all the robots \(or just those selected\) in a farm to a Queue at one time.
  * Set a mixed resource Queue to ‘Strict mode’ - In Queues where there is a mixture of human and robot resources, switching on 'Strict Mode' sets any human users in the Queue as fall-back resources only, only receiving work from here if its robots are for some reason currently unable to carry out the work in the Queue.
