# 1. Work Manager's Home Page

The Home page allows Team Leaders and Team Members to view the work for their area of business, i.e. Work Items sitting in their Work Queues and with their Team Members \(both human and robot\).

From the Work Items which you have permission on in your system, you will see:

* Work Items that are assigned to you
* Work Items that are assigned to your manager, i.e. the person you report to \(if you have one\)
* Work Items that are assigned to your peers \(people managed by the same person as you\)
* Work Items in a Queue that you are a member of / are a manager of.

Additionally, as a Team leader you will see:

* Work Items that are assigned to people you manage \(i.e. people who report to you\)
* Work Items that are assigned to people managed by people you manage \(recursively down the hierarchy of manager relationships\)
* Work Items in a Queue that you manage, even if you are not a member of it

Setting the users who report to you \(i.e. your Team\), and Queues which you manage can be done on the ‘Queues’ tab, which Team Leaders can access from the navigation links.
