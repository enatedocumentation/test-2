Two options are available:

1. **Do Not Send Acknowledgement Email** – The system will allow Tickets to be created for emails arriving from these addresses, but will not send any auto-response emails out to the address.
2. **Auto Reject as Spam** – The system will not create Tickets from emails arriving from this address.
