On the right hand side of the Home page is the Team Bar.

![](../.gitbook/assets/picture5.png)

This section shows you:

* **My Team** – The people in your Team and, for each of them:
  * The amount of work they have outstanding \(number in centre of pie-chart\)
  * The due status of that work \(i.e. Red/Amber/Green\)
  * Their current availability status \(online or offline\)
* **Bots** - Any Robots which are available to work on items you manage / work with, grouped by Robot farm :
  * Each robot row displays a different robot farm, along with their Technology \(e.g. UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism etc.\). The number of ‘bottable’ work items lined up for the robot farm will be displayed, as well as the estimated amount of work left available for the robot farm in minutes.
  * If any of the Robots in the farm are offline or unresponsive, a warning icon will be displayed
* **Unassigned Work** - You can see the amount of work which is sitting unassigned in the Queues you manage at the foot of this section, grouped into each Queue. Again, the RAG \(Red, Amber or Green\) status of that work can be seen. If you have unassigned work which is overdue – i.e. any red items in this section, you should be looking to deal with that situation.

You can sort your display of your team members by various criteria:

* Least / Most Work \(Total\)
* Least / Most Overdue \(Amber\)
* Least / Most Overdue \(Red\)
* Least / Most On Target \(Green\)
* You can use this to help identify resources which are stretched and other team member who you may be able to share work out among to help balance workloads
* You can filter the users being displayed to view those who are clocked on / off / both
* Free text search allows for you to search for individual users from the list

## A. Online / Offline Status for Team Members

This setting displays whether the person in question is currently online in the system.

### How does this work?

The system tracks your active Enate browser session, and so is able to check if they are still logged into Enate.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: if you do not log out properly, i.e. shut down the browser or machine directly without logging out of Enate, the system will display you as still online for the duration of the standard system timeout \(usually 30 minutes\).
{% endhint %}

An Important point is that this online/offline status is for informational purposes only – it is not taken into account as part of any allocation rules - i.e. the ‘Who does it go to?’ settings.

### Filter Team display by availability

The ‘My Team’ view section allows team leaders and members to filter the display of their team to show only available / only offline / all users.

## B. Team Bar for Team Members - Show / Hide Team Bar

If you are a Team Member, you won’t see the Bots section in your Team Bar, yo will only see your My Team section and you Unassigned Work section.
