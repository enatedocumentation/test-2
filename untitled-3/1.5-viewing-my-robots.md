# 1.5 Viewing my Robots

![](../.gitbook/assets/4%20%285%29.png)

* Clicking on a Robot farm in the Bots section swaps out the bar chart main display to show that group of robots AND filters down the grid results to show ‘bottable’ work items.
* On this view Team Leaders can:
  * See the status of individual robots within the robot farm:
    * Idle \(available\)
    * Offline
    * Suspended – the bot’s average work is not within standard deviation, so it has been paused
    * Busy Integrated – the bot is busy working on a task that is has been assigned to
    * Busy Independent- the bot is busy working on a task that it has not been assigned to
  * View the work currently being done by individual robots
  * Filter down the view to an individual robot
  * See how much work is remaining for the bots to do \(both in volume, e.g. 20 items, and in how many minutes worth of work is remaining, i.e. how long we think it will take to complete all of those 20 items\).
  * The system can make an estimate of the amount of work left in minutes because we have an ‘estimated duration’ value configured in Builder for different Actions. The system simply totals the value of these for the Actions currently available for the robots to do.
* * The grid will show projected start and end times for each piece of work, colour-coding the projected end date to show it if will breach the due datetime – this helps the Team Leader determine if they need to add further human / robot resources in order to meet SLAs.
* The view can be closed to return to the standard bar chart view of all work items.
