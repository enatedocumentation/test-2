# 13. Multilingual Support

Enate supports the following languages:

1. English
2. French
3. German
4. Romanian
5. Hungarian
6. Polish
7. Spanish
8. Portuguese Brazilian
9. Russian

The Operations environment for end users to deliver the service fully supports these languages and each user will be allowed to choose their preferred language along with date-time pattern in their user profile settings.

To set a preferred language, select a language from the Language dropdown list in User Settings.

The display of labels will appear in the logged-on user’s preferred language - this is achieved by adding a ‘language package’ into **Enate**. Each language package will have mapping for user-specific language like Portuguese, for example, ‘**Queue**’ will be ‘**Fila’** and ‘**Action’** will be ‘**Açao’** in Portuguese.

Here is the list of UI elements which will be available in the logged-on user’s preferred language:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Item</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Details</th>
