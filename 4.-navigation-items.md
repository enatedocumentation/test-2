## B. Queues

Clicking on 'Queues' in the navigation section, takes you to your Queues page where, as a Team Leader, you can see who reports to you and what Queues you are in charge of. For more information see [Setting Teams and Queues](2.-team-leader-setting-your-teams-and-queues.md).

## C. Views

This feature allows you to search for Work Items in your business area \(i.e. those which you have permissions on\). For more information see [Views of you Data](10.-views-of-your-data.md).

## D. Blocked Email Addresses

By clicking on 'Blocked Email Addresses' in the navigation dropdown, Work Manager users are able to easily see and maintain the list of email addresses to be blocked. 

Here you can add, edit and delete email addresses to be blocked.

Two options are available:

1. **Do Not Send Acknowledgement Email** – The system will allow Tickets to be created for emails arriving from these addresses, but will not send any auto-response emails out to the address.
2. **Auto Reject as Spam** – The system will not create Tickets from emails arriving from this address.

## E. Recently Accessed Work Items

If you wish to quickly re-access a work item \(e.g. you wish to re-open a work item tab you’ve just closed down\), open the ‘Recently Accessed’ link from the navigation dropdown.

This will display a list of the last 20 items which you have accessed \(along with datetime the tab was closed\), ordered by most recent first. Click an item to re-open the tab.
