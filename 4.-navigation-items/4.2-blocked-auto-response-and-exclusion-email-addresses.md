# 4.1 Blocked Email Addresses

By clicking on 'Blocked Email Addresses' in the navigation dropdown, Work Manager users are able to easily see and maintain the list of email addresses to be blocked. 

Here you can add, edit and delete email addresses to be blocked.

Two options are available:

1. **Do Not Send Acknowledgement Email** – The system will allow Tickets to be created for emails arriving from these addresses, but will not send any auto-response emails out to the address.
2. **Auto Reject as Spam** – The system will not create Tickets from emails arriving from this address.
