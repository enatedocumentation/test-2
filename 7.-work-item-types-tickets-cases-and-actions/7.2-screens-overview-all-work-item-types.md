# 7.2 Screens Overview: All Work Item Types

Work Item screens are made up of a number of collapsible cards which group together related information about that work item. There are a number of common features between Tickets, Cases and Actions and as such there is a single, consistent screen layout for all three \(with a small number of item-specific feature exceptions\).

The layout of the work item screens is composed of the following sections:

The sections in the screens are:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Header ribbon**](7.3-header-ribbon.md) – contains header-level information about the work item
2. \*\*\*\*[**Main section**](7.4-main-section-the-activities-tabs.md) – The main section to work out into. Contains:
   * Activities Tabs, allowing you to add notes, write emails, start Actions / sub-Cases.
   * Timelines section – Shows the activity for this work item in a chronological list. Filtered views allow you to see e.g. only the back and forth communications and notes. Actions are also displayed when looking at a Case.
   * \(Actions only\) – Checklists for the Action.
   * Smart Card can be configured to display custom data here \(See [Smart Cards](7.13-smart-cards.md) for more information\)
3. \*\*\*\*[**Side panel**](7.8-side-panel.md) – collapsible section with grouped information about the work item. See section below for further explanation. A Smart Card can also be added here.
