# 2.1 Queues management

#### A. Queues with multiple managers

Queues can be set to have more than one manager.

Example: Consider Manager 1 and Manager 2 as two team leads where Manager 1 needs visibility on the Queue of Manager 2. **Manager 1** can simply add the Queue of **Manager** **2** to his Queues page to have the visibility of the same.

Click on the edit option and add the specified Queue where it shows that the Queue is managed by **Manager 2**. This no longer removes managerial responsibility from the current manager.

If a Queue is managed by multiple managers then the users that are managed by you are filtered under **Managed by me** and the other users manged by other mangers are filtered under **Managed by others.**
