There are two types of notifications which you can receive \(described as different 'Groups'\): 

1. **Packet Activity** - these are generated when a work item is assigned to a user \(system notifies that user\). These notifications are created automatically by the system. When manually reassigning a work item, any text entered under 'Enter any notes that you would like to send with the piece of work' section of the screen is included in the notification information sent to users who the work item gets assigned to.

_Note: If you do a bulk reassign or reassign of work item from the Home page, the system only adds notes to audit and does not send notifications, but this will be available in the product soon._

1. **Process Messages** - these are generated as part of process, e.g. when a peer review Action fails or when an Action is unable to complete \(only in Case of push allocation method or if Case owner is set\).

Deleting notifications - Select a notification to delete. You have the option to delete all read notification by clicking 'select all' and then choosing 'delete selected messages'. The system will then delete all _read_ messages on that screen.
